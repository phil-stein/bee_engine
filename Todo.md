Todo

- general
  - [ ] setup release build
  - [ ] setup x86 build
- buggs
  - [x] loading images is really slow
  - [x] vm corrupts between run_init() and run_update()
  - [x] editor [show source code] cuts off the last line 
  - [x] solid objects don't get rendered in build_mode
  - [x] ~5-10 fps in build_mode *(prop. something being called that's unnecessary without the editor)*
  - [x] add entity >> cube doesn't get rendered
  - [x] attach script doesn't work anymore 
  - [ ] name & path of textures get randomly freed [prob. fixed]
  - [ ] importing assets sometimes crashes the editor
  - [ ] new camera component sometimes frees values
  - [ ] gravity scripts sometimes cant compile since adding the load_file delegate
- graphics
  - [ ] geometry shader normal direction
  - [ ] anti-aliasing
  - [ ] advanced blinn-phong
  - [ ] gamma correction
  - [ ] shadows
- editor
  - [x] asset manager
    - [x] register all assets
    - [x] load & store on demand
    - internal assets
      -  [x] default assets (missing texture, ...)
      -  [ ] automate the internal asset recognition
  - [ ] editor cam v. game cam (camera component)
    - [x] switching between editor / in-game camera
    - [x] camera gizmo
    - [ ] getting the view-matrix
    - [ ] assure always one camera in scene
    - [ ] integrate in gravity interface
  - [x] add entity
  - [x] deselect entities
  - [ ] visualize normal-direction
  - [ ] show shader source
  - [ ] gizmos
  - [ ] ...
- [ ] input 
  - [ ] mouse input 
  - [ ] controller input
- [ ] gravity scripting
  - [x] game is slow as h***
  - [x] camera interface
  - make it not crash when
    - [x] .gravity file not found
    - [x] .gravity file has errors
    - [x] wrong argument passed to function
    - [x] wrong argument amount
  - [x] this entity interface (`Entity -> this.rot_x()`)
  - [x] other entity interface (`World -> world.get_entity("name")`)
  - [ ] finish input interface
    - [x] all keys
    - [x] get_key() & get_key_down()
    - [ ] mouse interface
    - [ ] controller interface
    - [ ] actions like unity ???
  - [ ] load_file delegate for #import 
- [ ] in-engine text editor
  - [x] view source
  - [x] viewability
  - [ ] syntax highlighting
  - [ ] edit source ???
- [x] play-mode
  - [x] make it not be clear-color
  - [x] pause / start scripts
  - [x] ui
- [ ] physics-system

  - [ ] aabb v aabb
  - [ ] aabb v sphere
  - [ ] aabb v plane
- [ ] scene system

  - [ ] serialization
  - [ ] deserialization
  - [ ] switching
- [ ] particle system
  - [ ] object pooling
  - [ ] instancing 
  - [ ] textured & colored (also transparent)
  - [ ] billboards (no cam projection) 
- [ ] optimization
  - [ ] use uniform buffers for matrices and maybe lights
  - [ ] compress asset key strings into int's or float's
